## Post car:

Admin need to add cars in the list so I have use POST api to set the data in the database

### Get car:

After the post the cars will not able to shown in the website. So I have used GET to show the data in the UI.

### query by email:

By doing the query by email it is possible to show orders for individual users.

### Delete :

Users and admins can delete the orders and products. For that I do a query by id.

### Pending to Approved:

After the order the order is pending. I the admin approved it then the user can see it ts approved.
